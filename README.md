# Note Taker

## Description

- My motivation towards completing this project was in wanting to use my familiarity with Nodemon, server.js, dependencies within the package.json files, and using db/assets while wrapping them ALL together to create one whole of an application.
- I built this project to display what I have learned about Nodemon, server.js, and all things in accordance with deploying a local port.
- The problem solved within the challenge was not building a functioning app from the ground up, but instead trying to get it to run on a local port without failure.
- I learned how to deploy a functional app in a unique way!
